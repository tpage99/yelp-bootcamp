HTML Sanitizer was written by people far cleverer than me. I have just repackaged it to solve a problem I had (sanitization on a Node server). It seems to work, and it passes all its tests in re-packaged form - however I don't fully understand its internals so cannot guarantee its security.\n\n\n## More information\n\nhttp://code.google.com/p/google-caja/source/browse/trunk/src/com/google/caja/plugin/html-sanitizer.js\n","homepage":"http://github.com/theSmaw/Caja-HTML-Sanitizer","bugs":{"url":"http://github.com/theSmaw/Caja-HTML-Sanitizer/issues"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"genediazjr":true,"zeke":true,"deryk":true,"protovore":true,"firefoxnx":true,"reinoud":true},"license":"Apache-2.0","_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"dd1efb6c9b965d3ea781834d3f8c9fd1\"","_lastModified":"Sun, 27 May 2018 16:35:36 GMT"}
